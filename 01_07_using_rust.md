When using rust, we'll be using 3 programs:
* rustc: short for rust compiler, this is our compiler, it takes rust code and turns it into machine code that can be run. In the python world, this is like python.
* cargo: a wrapper around rustc, it can also manage dependencies, as well some other tools like tests, lintings, and more. It's like poetry on steroids.
* rustup: a program that manages your rust installations. It's like pyenv but official. Installing rustup automatically installs cargo and rustc.
