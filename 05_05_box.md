Another useful reference type is `Box<T>`. `Box` allows us to create and hold a value explicitly on the heap. This allows us to move it around as a reference without copying or holding the original value.

```rust
fn mk_array()->Box<[usize;1000]>{
   Box::new([0;1000])
}

fn main(){
    let b0 = mk_array();
    let b1 = b0; // b0 has been moved here, only one variable can hold a box at any one time
    println!("{}",b1.len());  // 1000
}
```

A reference to the object inside the `Box` can be extracted with `as_ref`

```rust
fn my_ref_function(r: &[usize]){}

fn my_box_function(x: Box<[usize]>){
    my_ref_function(x.as_ref())
}
```

Note that `Box`es only take a small amount of space on the stack, regardless of the data they actually contain. This means that we can use `Box`es to nest values.

```rust
enum LinkedList<T>{
    Empty,
    Cons{ value: T, next: Box<Self> }
}
```

# Exercise 1

Implement the following methods for `LinkedList`

* `new()`
* `from_iter(iter)`
* `nth(index)`

# Exercise 2

Implement a binary search tree
