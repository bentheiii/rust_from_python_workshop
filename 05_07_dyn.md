Smart pointers allocated to the heap offers us a new opportunity: dynamic dispatch.

Consider the following code:
```rust
trait Animal{
    fn diet(&self)->String;
    fn talk(&self);
}

struct Lion;
struct Fox;

impl Animal for Lion{
    fn diet(&self)->String {
        "zebra".to_string()
    }
    fn talk(&self){
        println!("Roar!");
    }
}

impl Animal for Fox{
    fn diet(&self)->String {
        "whatever's around".to_string()
    }
    fn talk(&self){
        panic!()
    }
}

struct Zoo<A: Animal>(Vec<A>);
```

If we try to use the `Zoo` struct, we'll run into a problem

```rust
let zoo = Zoo(vec![Lion, Lion, Fox]); // this will fail
```

```
error[E0308]: mismatched types
  --> src/main.rs:30:36
   |
30 |     let zoo = Zoo(vec![Lion, Lion, Fox]);
   |                                    ^^^ expected struct `Lion`, found struct `Fox`
```

Our `struct` is generic, but each instance of `Zoo` must be bound to a specific type of `Animal`. 

To solve this, we can use smart pointers to hold `dyn` object of a trait

```rust
struct SmartZoo(Vec<Box<dyn Animal>>)

let zoo = SmartZoo(vec![Box::new(Lion), Box::new(Lion), Box::new(Fox)]);

for animal in zoo.0{
    println!("{}",animal.diet())
}
/*
zebra
zebra
whatever's around
*/
```
