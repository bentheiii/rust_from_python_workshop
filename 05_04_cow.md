lifetimes are complex and annoying, and using them means that someone **has** to hold onto the original object. So let's learn about some smart pointers that make life bearable.

Consider the following case (python):

```python
def trail_0(x: list[int]):
    if len(x) > 0 and x[-1] == 0:
        return x
    return x + [0]
```

If we want to this in rust, we need to choose our return type
* if we return a `Vec`, we might need to copy all of `x` even when we don't have to 
  ```rust
  use std::iter;

  fn trail_0_vec(x: &[i32])->Vec<i32>{
      if let [.., 0] = x{
          x.iter().cloned().collect() // unnecessary copy
      } else {
          x.iter().cloned().chain(iter::once(0)).collect()
      }
  }
  ```
* but we can't return a slice because we still need someone to own the new `Vec` we might need to create
  ```rust
  fn trail_0_slice(x: &[i32])->&[i32]{
        if let [.., 0] = x{
            x
        } else {
            let v: Vec<_> = x.iter().cloned().chain(iter::once(0)).collect();
            &v[..]  // this will fail
        }
  }
  ```

To solve this, we can use a type from the standard library: `Cow<T>`

```
>>> cowsay Moo
  ___
< Moo >
  ---
         \   ^__^ 
          \  (oo)\_______
             (__)\       )\/\
                 ||----w |
                 ||     ||
```

`Cow` is short for "Clone On Write", it is an `enum` that can either hold the owned form of a value, or it's borrowed value

```rust
use std::borrow::Cow;

fn trail_0(x: &[i32])->Cow<[i32]>{
    if let [.., 0] = x{
        Cow::Borrowed(x)
    } else {
        Cow::Owned(x.iter().cloned().chain(iter::once(0)).collect())
    }
}
```

Since `Cow` implements the trait `Deref`, we can use the internal value as though it were a reference.

```rust
fn is_capitalized(x: Cow<str>)->bool{
    x.chars().nth(0).map_or(false, char::is_uppercase)
}
```

Note that `Cow` also has a lifetime parameter. `Cow<'a, T>` where `'a` is the lifetime of the borrowed value (if the value is borrowed). 

# Exercise
implement a function that accepts a `Cow<[usize]>` and returns a `Cow<[usize]>` that contains only non-zero values. Avoid all unnecessary copying (remember that if the input is `[0,0,1,3,5,0,0]`, you can return `[1,3,5]` without copying).
